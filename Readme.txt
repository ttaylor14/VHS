SQL Database Setup:

1. Download mssql on VS Code if you haven't yet. You'll need this extension to edit SQL syntax and run queries on the database. 

2. Once installed, run Cmd + Shift + P in VS Code and you'll see a search nav with a ">" show up Type "MS" and select "MS SQL Connect" 

3. Select "Create Connection Profile"

4. copy and paste the server name: vhsdb.database.windows.net

5. Select SQL Login

6. username: admin1 
password: HeckinGood!

7. Assuming you gave me the correct IP address it should connect. If not we can troubleshoot from there.


Use SQLTools for Azure connection

1. Click on the SQLTools icon

2. then add new connection

Group Project
Due: March 14, 2019

In this project, you will start by thinking about one entity or topic of your current company, a company that you want to start, or simply a process that you have experience in.  Think about everything that goes into that entity, how each process inside that entity relates to each other, and what database tables you think you would need to build this entity.  You will create a database and report to submit for this project.  Please complete the following steps:

1.	Write a brief summary of your entity, the tables you’re going to build, what keys are needed in those tables, how each table relates to each other, the fields in the tables and datatypes of those fields.
2.	Create the database using a database management system of your choice, except for Access.
3.	Create an ER diagram for your database.
a.	Be sure to identify all keys in this diagram.
4.	Write a summary of your ER diagram.  You should make sure that you explain the tables, keys, relationships and explain if it’s a 1:1, 1:N, or N:M relationship.
5.	In your summary, you want to explain if the database is normalized.
a.	Why do you feel it is normalized?
b.	If it’s denormalized, did you mean to design the database that way?
i.	If so, why do you feel that it is more beneficial to be denormalized?
ii.	If not, what can you do to make it normalized?
6.	Finish your summary with example SQL statements to pull data from multiple tables, using Joins and explain the statement.
7.	Identify what users will use your database.
8.	Identify what roles you will have on your database and what permissions those roles will have.
9.	Assign your users to roles.
